 ## Installation guide
========================= INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS NEEDS TO BE EDITED =========================
These are instructions to install and run the robot
porgram for Project 3. These instructions are for WINDOWS machines

### POSSIBLE GEANY INSTALLATION GUIDE?

### SFML Installation
1) Firstly, you want to go to the following URL and install a SFML.zip file.
Take care to ensure you download the correct version of SFML for your computer for
your corresponding IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For example, if you
use Visual Studio, download SFML for Visual Studio, if you have a 32 bit computer, download
the version for 32 bit computers. Also ensure your IDE Compiler and the SFML file versions
match! 

https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

2) After downloading the zip file, extract all of the contents of the zip file out. The resultant
folder should be called 'SFML...' with the ... being the version number. Rename that folder to ONLY
'SFML'.
